                                OBJECTIVE

       The objective of Balloon Challenge is to get your 25 colored
       balloons as high as you can on the game board.  The higher the
       balloon goes, the higher the points awarded.  The player with
       the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.


                                GAME PLAY

       At the start of a new game, the computer will decide who goes
       first.  The computer always plays the Yellow balloons.  At the
       bottom of the screen you will see your 25 balloons ready to be
       launched.  There will be a white square drawn around the first
       balloon.  Using your <Arrow Keys> move the marker to select the
       balloon you want to launch into the sky.  To release the balloon,
       press the <Spacebar> key.


                                GAME OBJECTS

       There are many different objects in the sky that you will have to
       either utilize or avoid, in your quest to get the balloon as high
       into the sky maze as possible.  There are Airplanes, Dark Clouds,
       Bonus Clouds, Directional Clouds and Hurricanes.


       Airplanes:     will destroy your balloon if you hit one.  They
                      continue to move one space at a time across the sky
                      for each turn.

       Dark Clouds:   will stop the balloons from going higher.

       Directional:   will send the balloons in the direction of their
       Clouds         arrow.  Once a balloon has hit one of these
                      clouds, the arrow will change to the other direction.

       Hurricanes:    will move your balloon to a random place on game
                      board, and it will continue to climb higher if it
                      is able to do so.

       Bonus Points:  If you can get your balloon to go through one of
                      these clouds marked with a '10', then you will get
                      an extra 10 points added to your score.  These bonus
                      clouds can only be captured once per game.



                                  SCORING

       Points are awarded for all the balloons which are located on the
       game board.  Every row higher is worth 5 points.  Since there
       are 15 rows, a balloon that reaches the very top will have a
       value of 75 points.

       Once all the balloons have been released by both players, the
       game will be over.  The player with the highest score will be
       the winner.

       All balloons that are stuck on their launching pad because of an
       object directly above them, will be considered a grounded balloon
       because they will not be able to reach the first row.  They will
       be automatically removed by the computer.


                              KEYS / OPTIONS

       All key definitions are shown below the game board at all times.

                <D>irections   <O>ptions   <N>ew Game   <Q>uit

       The <O>ption key brings up a menu which allows you to toggle the
       Sound on or off.  There is also some information about Soleau
       Software and our EGA/VGA games.
