    The object of the game is to break free from each level by destroying
    all the breakable walls with your fireballs.  When you lose your last
    fireball, the game is over.

    You can keep your fireballs in play by bouncing them off an invisible
    paddle directly in front of you.  You must constantly predict where
    each fireball will return, and move yourself to intercept it. You can
    move forward, backward, and from side to side, with either the arrow
    keys or the mouse.

    KEYS:
        Arrow keys = move up/back/left/right
        +/- keys   = resize the main viewscreen
        Space      = launch more fireballs
        S          = toggle Sound on/off
        W          = Warp to another level
        Ctrl       = fire gun (only if you have a gun)
        Esc        = show the Main Menu
        F1         = show these Help screens

    SCREEN:

    The top of the screen has the main viewscreen, where the game action
    takes place.  At the bottom of the screen are several fields
    which indicate your current play status:

        +--------+  +-------------------+ +-----+ +-----+ +--------+
        |  ammo  |  | level name        | |lev.#| |timer| |        |
        |  count |  +-------------------+ +-----+ +-----+ |        |
        |        |  +----------+ +--------------+         |        |
        | weapon |  | SCORE    | | score        |  S S I  | radar  |
        |        |  +----------+ +--------------+         |        |
        |        |  +-----------------------------------+ |        |
        |        |  | fireballs remaining and in play   | |        |
        +--------+  +-----------------------------------+ +--------+

        - ammo count/weapon.  Shows gun (if any) and ammo remaining.
        - level name. This is used for warping.
        - level number.
        - timer.  This shows the time remaining to complete the level.
        - score.
        - fireballs remaining.  Empty circles are balls currently in play.
        - radar.  This displays an overhead view of the current level.
          Colors in the radar indicate different items:

              dark red  = unbreakable walls
              light red = breakable walls
              dark grey = power drain walls
              yellow    = fireballs in play
              green     = you

    SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

    BreakFree requires 520K of free conventional memory and 256-color VGA
    graphics to play.  SoundBlaster compatible sound cards are supported.
    We recommend a 20 MHZ 386 computer as the minimal speed/processor,
    but you can try it on a slower machine if you like.
