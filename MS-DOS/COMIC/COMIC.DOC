                                Introduction


        The Adventures of Captain Comic started out as an experiment to
        test the viability of two theories, the first as to whether a
        real arcade type game can be done on a standard IBM PC with an
        EGA card, and sencondly, given the first can be done, if it is
        possible to make any money doing it.  Well, I've come to a
        conclusion on the second point, but I'll let you judge the first
        point for yourself.

                      The Adventures of Captain Comic 
 
                               Instructions 
 
 
 
I.   Game Objective 
 
        You are Captain Comic, galactic hero.  Your mission is to 
        recover three treasures from the planet Omsoc, which 
        have been stolen away and hidden somewhere on the remote 
        planet of Tambi. 
 
        Your task will not be easy, you will need to gather tools to 
        increase your fighting and defensive capability, navigate 
        dangerous terrain, and avoid or destroy a hoard of deadly 
        creatures.  It will take all of the Captain's skill and wit 
        to see the treasures returned to Omsoc. 
 
 
II.  Starting the Game 
 
        - This program requires an IBM PC, XT or AT and an EGA display 
          adapter with 256K of RAM.  The program will also function 
          with the IBM PS2 line using EGA emulation. 
 
        - Insert the Captain Comic Program Disk in your default disk 
          drive and type 'COMIC'. 
 
        - A title will be displayed while the game loads.  When the 
          game has finished loading, press any key to view the text 
          introduction.  After the text introduction, the game will start. 


 
III. Game Control 
 
    Left Arrow      - When pressed quickly, makes COMIC face from 
                      right to left.  When facing left, moves COMIC 
                      to the left. 
 
    Right Arrow     - Operates the same as left arrow, but moves 
                      COMIC to the right. 
 
    Space Bar       - Makes COMIC jump.  Jumping height is increased 
                      by the length of time the space bar is depressed. 
                      A certain amount of left/right directional 
                      control is available to COMIC while in the air 
                      by using the left/right movement keys. 
 
    Insert Key      - After COMIC has gathered at least 1 can of 
                      BLASTOLA COLA, this key will allow him to 
                      fire.  Note that with the addition of every 
                      can of cola, COMIC can have one more fireball 
                      in the air simultaneously.  When he has all five 
                      cans, COMIC's stream of bullets can reach across 
                      the entire playfield.  While the fire key is 
                      depressed, COMIC's "Fire Energy" is decreased. 
                      When the level of energy reaches zero, COMIC 
                      will no longer be able to fire. The fire 
                      energy level recharges when the fire button 
                      is released. 
 
    Alt             - When COMIC has possession of the DOOR KEY, this 
                      key is used to open doors.  To open a door and 
                      pass through, position COMIC in front of the 
                      door and press Alt.  The door will slide open
                      and COMIC will disappear, finding himself 
                      elsewhere... 
 
    Caps Lock       - When COMIC has possession of the WAND, this 
                      key is used to teleport to another place on the 
                      screen.  Press Caps Lock and COMIC disappears
                      in a cloud of smoke, and re-appears in a new 
                      place on the screen.  The teleportation is not 
                      random, and when used properly, can allow COMIC 
                      to reach places on the screen that are normally 
                      inaccessible. 
 
    Esc             - Used to Pause or Quit the game. 
 
    F1              - Turns sound ON 
 
    F2              - Turns sound OFF 



IV.  Game Rules 
 
        COMIC starts the game with 5 lives, and no objects in his 
        inventory.  COMIC uses two different types of energy during 
        battle, weapon energy and shield energy.  Weapon energy is 
        self-charging, and recharges when not in use.  Shield energy 
        can be recharged by picking up extra shields located on the 
        playfield. 
 
        When an enemy comes in contact with COMIC, the shield energy 
        is reduced.  After the shield energy reaches zero, any further 
        contact with an enemy creature will destroy COMIC.  COMIC can 
        also be killed by falling off the bottom of the playfield 
        area of the screen. 
 
        Points are earned by shooting enemy creatures, gathering 
        objects on the planet's surface, and for excess shield units 
        remaining after charging. 
 
        Extra lives are earned at every 50,000 points, by gathering 
        a shield while current shield energy is already at max, and 
        for every treasure collected. 
 
        The game will end after COMIC retrieves all three treasures 
        or when all spare lives are exhausted.  The treasures include 
        rare gems, a sack of rare coins and a jeweled crown. 
 
        The following tools can be found during COMIC's adventure on 
        Tambi: 
 
        SHIELD         - Restores COMIC's shield energy.  Points are 
                         scored for excess shield units. 
 
        BLASTOLA COLA  - Increased COMIC's firing ability.  Up to five 
                         cans of cola can be collected for a shot max 
                         of five fireballs in air simultaneously. 
 
        CORKSCREW      - Makes COMIC fire in a corkscrew type wave 
                         pattern.  This is very useful for destroying 
                         creatures which crawl on the ground below 
                         COMIC's normal line of fire. 
 
        DOOR KEY       - Allows COMIC to open doors found in various 
                         places on Tambi. 
 
        BOOTS          - Increases COMIC's maximum jumping distance. 
                         This is useful in reaching ledges which were 
                         previously too high to jump to. 



        LANTERN        - There are a few places on Tambi which will 
                         appear dark to COMIC without the aid of this 
                         device. 
 
        WAND           - This is certainly the most powerful tool to be 
                         found on Tambi.  Undoubtedly placed on Tambi 
                         by a powerful wizard, the wand gives its 
                         possessor to ability to teleport through walls 
                         and across voids. 
 
 
V.   Hints 
 
        - The Captain will have travel through 8 distinctly different 
          areas on Tambi.  The tools found and enemy difficulty varies 
          from place to place.  If one approach seems impossible, try 
          another.  Once you discover the best way to traverse on Tambi, 
          the Captain's job will be much easier. 
 
        - When the game starts, the Captain will have a very low offensive 
          capability, and thus firing should be restrained to short range. 
          As COMIC gains in offensive capability, the most effective way to 
          fire will be in short bursts by holding down the FIRE key.  COMIC 
          will not fire any faster by repeatedly pressing the FIRE key. 
 
        - As firing ability grows, try firing simultaneously while at the 
          start of the jump.  This will destroy most of the enemies that are 
          waiting in the wings. 
 
        - Learn where to jump.  Some of the gaps in the ground can be crossed 
          only by leaping, but there is a large number of places where COMIC 
          can cross by simply walking over the gap.  Unfortunately, this can 
          only be learned through trial and error.  As a general rule however, 
          for short gaps, COMIC can walk over a one step gap for every step 
          down his destination. 
 
        - Remember it possible to win.  More than that, its possible to win 
          without losing a single life. (It's just not easy.)  Current high 
          score at the time of release is 1,344,500 points.
