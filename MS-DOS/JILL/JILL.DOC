Jill of the Jungle is a Nintendo-style arcade adventure game with 256-color
VGA graphics,  great sound effects,  and a Sound Blaster-compatible musical
sound track.  This immense game world,  Volume I in the Jill series,
challenges both your mind and your arcade reflexes -- fun for the whole
family!

We are Epic MegaGames and we're here to bring you the best in animated games
for your PC.  Our 20-person team is busy at work to make new products to
challenge and entertain you.

   HINT

This game is equiped with a "Save" feature -- so remember to save your game
often.  Later on,  if your bratty little brother unplugs the computer
while you are playing,  you won't need to start over!

   JILL OF THE JUNGLE IS SHAREWARE:

Yes,  Jill is shareware!  This means you are encouraged to pass copies of
Jill around to everybody you know -- give Jill to your friends, upload Jill
to your favorite BBS's.

If you enjoy Jill,  you can continue your adventure by buying Jill Volumes
II and III (Jill Goes Underground and Jill Saves the Prince).  These action-
packed games contain loads of new action, excitement, graphics, and music!

Run PRINTME to fill out an order form,  and run CATALOG to hear about other
products from Epic MegaGames.

   HOW TO START:

To go,  just type JILL1 from the DOS prompt -- and you're ready to begin.
If you don't have a 100% IBM-compatible computer with at least 512K of RAM
and color graphics,  go buy one now!  Jill is a high-tech game which requires
a lot of computing power (An 80286 processor is recommended).

   NOTE TO SOUND BLASTER OWNERS:

Jill sports a musical sound track and digitized sound effects.  If you
experience trouble with Jill (lockups or aborts), try booting from a blank
floppy disk with no TSR's loaded.  If this doesn't solve the problem, your
best bet is to <gasp> turn OFF the digital sound effects.
