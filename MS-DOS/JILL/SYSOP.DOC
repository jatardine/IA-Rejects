
To All Sysops,

    Thanks for distributing Jill of the Jungle,  the first release in the Epic
MegaGames line of 256-color animated VGA games.  You will be hearing a lot
more from us lately -- we'll be releasing at least five new products in 1992,
so keep in touch!

     Also -- we're looking for a few great BBS's to become official Epic
MegaGames release points.  How would you like to have the popular Epic file
area on your board?  This is a great way to attract users to your system!

     If you are interested, please get in touch.  Be the first in your
area to get in on this opportunity and have your file area in place when
the big Epic rush starts -- with the release of Jill of the Jungle,
KiloBlaster, and Drum Traker.  (These are HOT products!)
