pyramid

The objective of pyramid is to clear the screen of all
cards (tableau, stock and waste pile).

Twenty-eight cards have been dealt into a pyramid-shaped
tableau,where the rows of 1 to 7 cards are overlapping.
Only the fully exposed cards are "available" to be played
(with one exception, noted below).

The cards are removed from the screen in pairs that total
13 points each, with the card "point value" equal to its
face value.  Since the king has a value of 13, it is the
only card that is removed by itself.  The queen (12) is
removed with the Ace (1), the jack (11) with the 2, the 10
with the 3, the 9 with the 4, the 8 with the 5, and the 6
with the 7.  Removal of cards is done without regard to suit
or color.

Cards are removed by first selecting one "available" card
(it will light up) and then selecting its "available" pair.
If the two cards selected total 13 point they will disappear
from the screen.

An exception to the "available card" rule on the tableau is
if a card is covered only by its pair, then both cards can
be removed by selecting the fully exposed card first.

Begin play be removing all of the pairs (or Kings) that
can be played from the tableau.  Then, turn the cards from
the stock one at a time, pairing the stock card with
either an avaliable card from the tableau, or the top card
of the waste pile.  (The top cards from the stock, the
waste pile, and available cards from the tableau, are
all playable.)  If the stock card cannot be played it is
placed on the waste pile.

The game is over when no more "pairs" can be removed.  To
"win" you must remove all cards from the screen (stock,
waste pile and tableau).
