tournament play:

tournament play is an option whereby any number of players
can compete with the same "shuffle".  You can choose any or
all of the games listed in the tour.  In this manner,
players can challenge each other to see who can score the
highest on any of the games.

You have the option of going to a new "shuffle" by either
selecting another tournament game or leaving the tournament
menu entirely by selecting end tournament play.  You can
then select tournament play again from the start a new game
menu.
