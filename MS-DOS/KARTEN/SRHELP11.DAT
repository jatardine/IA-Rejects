Childrens Games Instructions:

1)  concentration

The objective of concentration is to "match" cards of the
same face value.  After the game is selected, a choice can
be made between one-player and two-player (competitive)
operation.

At the start of the game, twenty-four cards are face down on
the screen.  Select any card and it will turn face up.  Then
select a second card to try and make a match.  If the two
cards match, both will disappear from the screen. (Cards are
matched according to number, or "face value"; in other
words, 3 of Hearts to 3 of Spades, Jack to Jack, etc.) If
there is no match, both cards will turn face down again, and
the process is repeated until all cards have been paired and
removed.  It's important to remember what cards you have
seen and their position for future matching, thus the name
"concentration".

In one player mode, you can keep track of the total number
of "moves" on the left side of the screen.  Any time a card
is turned face up counts as a move.  When playing alone,
your goal is to match all the pairs in the fewest amount of
moves.

In two-player mode, points are tallied on the left side of
the screen for each player.  Every time a player removes a
pair of cards, that player scores 2 points.  When a card
other than the matching pair is selected, that player loses
his or her turn.  The objective in the two-player game is to
match the most pairs.

2)  pairs

This is a simple pairs matcing game, where you match sixteen
pairs of cards according to "face value".  Thirty-two cards
are used, with 16 cards dealt face up into the tableau
pattern, and the final 16 in a holding pile in the center of
the screen.  Turn a card over from the holding pile by
selecting the pile itself.

Start play by matching this available card with one from the
tableau.  (Cards are matched according to number, or "face
value".)  As you match the two cards, they will disappear
from the screen.

When a card has been removed from the tableau, it is
automatically replaced by the top card of the holding pile.
Continue play by selecting the holding pile again to turn
the top card face up, and make it available to play.

Until the holding pile has been eliminated, pairs selected
must include the face up card on the holding pile and one
card from the tableau.  After the holding pile is gone, any
two "like" cards can be matched from the tableau.

There is an exeption to this rule:  For one time, and one
time only, if no match is available using the holding pile,
two cards from the tableau can be matched.  After this one
time, cards from the tableau cannot be matched together
until the holding pile is gone.

Play continues until all the cards are gone or no more
matches can be made.

3)  the wish

Legend has it that this game was first used by lovers to
discover if they were being loved in return (much like the
use of a daisy, "She loves me... she loves me not...).
this game was played with a lover in mind..., and if
won, love was returned.

It has evolved into a children's game where it is said that
a wish made will come true to the winner.

In the wish, the player must match "like" cards.  Thirty-two
cards are dealt in 8 piles of 4 cards each, with the cards
face up in each of the piles.  As cards are matched, they
will be removed from the screen and the next card will turn
face up.  Play continues until all of the cards are gone, or
no more matches can be made.

Since there are four cards of each type, both luck and skill
are involved in winning the game and getting "the wish". If
you can match all the cards, the game is won and you can
make another "wish".
