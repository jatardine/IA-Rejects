Basic Definitions and Play-Action

All of the solitaire games in Solitaire Royale have two
basic goals in common:

* Move all cards to the foundation; or

* Remove the cards from the screen completely.

With these goals in mind, the following terms are used in
each game:

* The "foundation" is the pile (or piles) where cards are
laid in a specific order during the course of a game.  Some
games will not have a foundation, as the objective may be to
completely remove the cards from the screen.  The foundation
receives cards from the tableau, holding pile, stock, and
waste pile.

* The "tableau" is the general layout of cards upon which
other cards are played prior to moving them to eiter the
foundation or the waste pile.  Cards placed on the tableau
after the opening layout may come from either the holding
pile, stock, or waste pile.

* The "stock" is the remainder from a standard deck of 52
playing cards which are not yet displayed on the screen.
The player turns (exposes) cards from the stock, either 1 or
3 cards at a time, as the game is being played.

* The "waste pile" is made up of cards turned from the stock
that cannot be played as yet to the tableau or foundation.
As each top card is played, the one below it becomes
available.  Some games allow for the waste pile to be turned
over and restarted after the last stock card has been
"turned" to it.

* The "holding pile" consists of cards that are placed face
down on the screen, to be turned up 1 at a time for play on
the tableau or foundation according to the rules of the
specific game.  As each top card is played, the card below
it becomes available for play.

* The "score" is the number of cards that have either been
removed from the screen, or moved to the foundation after
all possible plays have been  made.  The highest score wins
in any solitaire royale game, and 52 is the highest possible
score per game.
