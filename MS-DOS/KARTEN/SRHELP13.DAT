General rules for computer play:

* The "Arrow" cursor must be pointing at a card before it
can be selected.

* For keyboard use:
- Move the Arrow to the card (or column) you want to
select by pressing the "cursor" keys on the numeric pad
(only the left & right and the up & down keys will move
the cursor).

- Select the card (or column) to be played by pressing the
"Enter" key, or the "Spacebar".  When the card is selected
it will be highlighted.

- Move the Arrow to the place you want the card to be
played and press the "Enter" key again.

The "ESC" key activates the menus bar.

- The "home" key is a quick way to place the arrow cursor
onto the stock pile.  (Exceptions: For three shuffles and a
draw, and concentration, where pressing "home" moves the
cursor to the card stack in the upper left corner.  Pressing
"home" has no effect on the wish)

* For mouse use:
- Use the Arrow to point at the card (or column) you
want to select.

- "Click" the left mouse button to select the desired
card (or column).   When the card is selected it will be
highlighted.

- Move the arrow to the place you want the card to be
 played and click the left button once more.

Clicking the right mouse button activates the menus bar.
