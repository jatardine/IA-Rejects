golf

The objective of golf is to move all of the cards to the
foundation (one pile, in this case).

The tableau has been dealt thirty-five cards (7 across and 5
down, overlapping).  Only fully exposed cards in the
tableau and the top card of the stock are available to
play on the foundation.

Cards are moved from the tableau in either ascending or
descending order (regardless of suit) according to the top
card on the foundation.  Aces are considered "low" and Kings
theare "high" cards. (Therefore, once an Ace is played to
the foundation, only a 2 and not a King can be played on
it.)

Play begins from the top card of the foundation.  For
example, if the top card of the foundation is a 4, then a
5 or a 3 can be played from tableau to the foundation.
(Merely selecting a card will move it to the foundation.)
If a 5 is moved to the foundation, then a 4 or a 6 may be
played from the tableau.  Play continues in this way until
none of the fully exposed cards can be played.

At this point, the top card from the stock is played to the
foundation, and play from the tableau is resumed.
Whenever a king is played, tableau play stops and the next
card must be selected from the stock before play can be
resumed from the tableau.

The game is over when there are no more cards in the stock
and none can be removed from the tableau.  To "win"
you must remove all cards from the tableau.
