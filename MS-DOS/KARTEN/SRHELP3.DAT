The objective is to move all of the cards to the
foundation.

twendy-eight cards are dealt into a tableau of 7 columns,
with the first column on the left containing 1 card, the
second column 2 cards, and continuing to the 7th column
which contains 7 cards.  When the game begins, all cards in
the tableau are face down except for the "fully exposed" top
card in each column which is face up.  Only fully exposed
cards in the tableau are "available" to be played on.

The stock is "turned" 3 cards at a time onto a waste pile.
Merely selecting the stock pile will "turn" the cards. If
the top card of the waste pile can be played on either the
tableau or the foundation, the next waste pile card becomes
available for play, and so forth.  When the entire stock has
been turned onto the waste pile, it is available to be
turned again by selecting the dotted-line area where the
stock would normally be located.  This process can be
repeated until no available cards from the stock and waste
pile can be played.

Cards are played on each other in the tableau in
order (K,Q,J,10,9,etc.) alternating red (hearts or diamonds)
and black (clubs or spades).  As long as this pattern is
maintained in each column, cards can be played on the
tableau from the top card of the waste pile, or by
"available" cards from the other columns in the tableau.

Cards are available in the tableau to play on other
columns if they are the first face-up card in the column.
If this card has other cards played on it already, all cards
move as a unit to the new location.  Kings can also be
played to vacant columns emptied by the movement of cards to
the foundation or to other columns.

The foundation is built up from the ace in ascending order
(according to suit) in the spaces available above the
tableau.  Cards may be played to the foundation from the
tableau or the waste pile.

The game ends when no more plays are possible from the
tableau or the waste pile .  To "win" you must move all
cards from the tableau and waste pile to the foundation,
building each suit in order from Ace to King, one card at a
time.
