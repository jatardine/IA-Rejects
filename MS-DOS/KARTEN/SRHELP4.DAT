canfield

The objective of canfield is to move all of the cards to the
foundation.

The cards are dealt into a tableau of 4 columns, with each
column containing 1 card.  When the game begins, all 4
cards in the tableau are face up and there is a holding
pile to the left of and slightly below the tableau.  The
holding pile contains 13 cards with the top card
face up and available.

The stock is "turned" 3 cards at a time onto the waste pile.
If the top card of the waste pile can be played on either
the tableau or the foundation, the next card becomes
available to be played, etc.  When the entire stock has been
turned onto the waste pile, it is available to be turned
again by selecting the dotted-line area here the stock would
normally be located.

Cards are played onto the tableau in descending order
(K,Q,J,10,9,etc.) while alternating red (hearts or diamonds)
and black (clubs or spades).  As long as this pattern is
maintained in each column, plays can be made to the tableau
from the waste pile and holding pile, or from "available"
cards in other columns of the tableau. The cards in the
holding pile can also be played to empty columns in the
tableau.  When the holding pile is depleted, any "available"
King from the waste pile can be used to fill an empty
column.

A card is "available" in the tableau to be played on other
columns if it is the topmost card in its respective column.
If this card has others played on it already, all cards move
as a unit to the new location.

The foundation is built up from the Ace in ascending order,
according to suit, in the spaces available above the
tableau.  Cards may be played to the foundation from the
waste pile, tableau, or holding pile.

The game ends when no more plays are possible from the
tableau, waste pile, or holding pile.  To "win" you
must move all cards from these locations to the foundation,
building each suit in order from Ace to King, one card at a
time.
