corners

The objective of corners is to move all the cards to the
foundation.

The cards have been dealt into a tableau of 5 cards in the
pattern of a "cross", or a box with the "corners" missing.
Also, the first card of the foundation has been dealt onto
the top left "corner" of the box.  The foundation piles are
the four corners of the box.  Each initial foundation pile
card played into the remaining corners must have the same
face value as the original foundation card dealt onto the
top left corner.  When completed each foundation pile will
contain all 13 cards of a suit.

The stock is "turned" 1 card at a time onto the waste
pile, from which the top card is available to be played on
the tableau or the foundation.  In corners, the waste pile
cannot be turned over and replayed as stock a second time.
The only way to play from the waste pile is with the current
topmost card.  When the entire stock has been turned once
and no more cards can be played (from either the waste pile
or tableau), the game is over.

Cards are played onto the tableau (cross) in descending
order regardless of suit.  As long as this pattern is
maintained in each stack, cards can be played onto the
tableau from the top card of the stock, "available" cards
from tableau stacks, or the top card of the waste pile.

Cards are available in the tableau to be played on other
tableau stacks if they are the top-most card in a stack.
Only playable cards are moved to tableau stacks or
foundation piles.

The foundation is built up (from the first card dealt to
the foundation) in ascending order and according to suit.
Cards may be played to the foundation from the tableau,
stock, or top card of the waste pile.

Note: Aces and Kings are neigher high nor low, but merely
part of a cycle whose direction depends on whether play is
on the tableau or the foundation.

The game ends when no more plays are possible from the
tableau, and/or the stock and waste pile are exhausted.  To
"win" you must move all cards from the tableau, stock and
waste pile to the foundation, building up each suit in
order from the originally dealt foundation cards, one card
at a time.
