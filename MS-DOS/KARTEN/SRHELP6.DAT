calculation

The objective of calculation is to move all of the cards to
the foundation.

The game begins with a tableau of 4 patential columns, with
each column containing no cards at the outset.  The
foundation has been dealt with 1 starting card for each of
the 4 piles.  The foundation piles are built up
(regardless of suit) by 1's in the first pile
(Ace,2,3,etc.), 2's in the second pile (2,4,6,etc.), 3's in
the third pile (3,6,9,Queen,etc.), and 4's in the fourth
pile (4,8,Queen,etc.).  The name of this game comes from the
necessity of "calculating" which card to play next on each
of the piles. Build up the foundation piles as follows:

              A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K
              2,4,6,8,10,Q,A,3,5,7,9,J,K
              3,6,9,Q,2,5,8,J,A,4,7,10,K
              4,8,Q,3,7,J,2,6,10,A,5,9,K

The stock is "turned" 1 card at a time onto the screen, and
then played either onto the foundation or in any of the
four tableau columns (where the cards are "held" until they
can be played to the foundation).

Once a card has been placed in one of the tableau columns,
that card can only be moved to a foundation pile, and only
the fully exposed card in each column is "available" to be
played.

The game ends when no more plays are possible from the
tableau and the stock is exhausted.  To "win" you must
move all cards from the tableau and stock to the
foundation, building each pile according to the
"calculation" rules stated above.
