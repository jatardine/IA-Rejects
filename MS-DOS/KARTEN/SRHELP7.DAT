three shuffles and a draw

The objective of three shuffles and a draw is to move all of
the cards to the foundation.

The cards have been dealt into a tableau of 16 stacks of 3
cards each.  When the game begins all 48 cards in the
tableau are face up, and the aces are in place as the
beginning of each foundation pile.

Cards are played from stacks in the tableau to other
stacks there, in descending order and according to
suit.  To reach your objective, you need to "free up" cards
so they are playable onto the foundation row (in ascending
order and according to suit).

Only the topmost available card in any tableau stack can be
played on other stacks or the foundation piles.

There is a option to "reshuffle" the cards in the tableau
twice after the original layout is dealt, to be taken when
no additional cards can be played to the foundation.  The
foundation cards remain on the screen during the reshuffles.
In addition, the player gets 1 "draw" to pick an
"unavailable" card from behind anohter card (or group of
cards)  that is blocking it in a tableau stack.  It is
usually good strategy to wait until after the final shuffle
to take the draw.

The game is over when all shuffles and the draw have been
taken and there are no further plays available.  The "win"
comes when all cards are moved to the foundation.
