reno

The objective of reno is to move all of the cards to the
foundation.

The cards are dealt into a tableau of 4 columns, with each
column containing 1 card. When the game begins, all 4 cards
in the tableau are face up and there is a holding pile to
the left of and slightly below the tableau (similar to
canfield).  The holding pile contains 13 cards, with the top
card face up and available.

The stock is "turned" 1 card at a time onto the screen.
This card can be played on the tableau, foundation, or laid
onto its adjacnt waste pile.  After playing the turned card
in any manner, the next card becomes avaliable to be played,
etc.  Unlike canfild, however, the waste pile cards cannot
be turned a second time.  The only way to play from the
waste pile is with the current topmost card.  When the
entire stock has been turned and no more cards can be played
from the waste pile, tableau, or holding pile, the game is
over.

Cards are played onto the tableau in descending order
(K,Q,J,10,9,etc.), while alternating red (hearts or
diamonds) and black (clubs or spades).  As long as this
pattern is maintained in each column, cards can be played
onto tableau stock, waste pile, holding pile, or
"available" cards in other columns of the tableau.  The
cards in the holding pile can also be played to empty
columns in the tableau.  When the holding pile is depleted,
any "available" King from the stock or waste pile can be
used to fill an empty column.

A card is "available" in the tableau to be played on other
columns if it is the topmost card in its respective column.
If this card has other cards played upon it, all cards move
as a unit to the new location.

The foundation is built up from the Ace in ascending order
(according to suit) in the spaces available above the
tableau.  Cards may be played to the foundation from the
stock, waste pile, tableau, or holding pile.

The game ends when no more plays are possible from the
stock, waste pile, tableau, or holding pile.  To "win" you
must move all cards to the foundation building each suit in
order from Ace to King, one card at a time.

This game is scored as a "betting" format.  The deck "costs"
$52 and the player is "paid" $5 for every card moved to
the foundation.  When 11 cards have been moved to the
foundation the player has $55 and has "recovered" the cost
of the game.  The most that can be won is $260, when all
cards have been moved to the foundation.
