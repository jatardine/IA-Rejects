Instructions for tour:

The objective of the tour is to play all eight of the
"adult" solitaire games consecutively and accumulate the
highest possible score.  There is a seperate scoreboard for
each tour that keeps track of each game played therein and
the total for that specific tour, as well as a "high scores"
board that records the top 5 scores to disk.

In addition, tour is included as part of the tournament
menu, making it possible for more than one person to play
the same tour, and have the top 5 scores for that specific
tour saved to disk as well.

To begin a tour, bring up the menu bar and select tour (Aunt
Anne's game) from the start a new game menu.  The games are
played in the order that they appear on the meuu:  pyramid,
golf, klondike, canfield, corners, calculation, three
shuffles and a draw, and reno.

Play the pyramid game, and when the game has been
completed, go to the menu bar and select continue to next
game from the tour menu.  A tour scoreboard will appear,
showing the score for pyramid.  Pressing the enter key (or
the left mouse button) will cause the next game to appear,
in this instance golf.  Continue in this manner until the
tour is completed.  Before each game begins, the tour
scoreboard will reappear, showing the scores for all the
games completed to that point.
