Enclosed on this disk is the bonus game COMMANDER KEEN.

It is in a compressed format and cannot be played as it was shipped to you.
Please follow the following three steps to play COMMANDER KEEN.

1) To play this game you must copy the file "KEEN.EXE" to a hard disk, or
   a 720k 3«" floppy, or a high density 1.2meg disk.

2) Once copied, change the DOS prompt to where the newly copied "KEEN.EXE"
   file is and type "KEEN", which will cause the game to uncompress.

3) Once uncompressed, you can type "KEEN1" to play the game.

You will need about 530k free RAM to run the game, plus have an EGA or
VGA graphics card.

Enjoy the game...
