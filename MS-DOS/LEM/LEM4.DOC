Command Line Switches
---------------------

	-a	Switches off the adlib board autodetect
	-m	Mono monitor being used
	-n	Switches off the mouse autodetect
		Note:- Lemmings will not work on a few older machines because
		they do not take mice into consideration, switching off the
		mouse autodetect should cure the problem.

Requirements
------------

 Lemmings Demo requires 512k of memory and either CGA, TANDY, EGA, or VGA 
display adapter (EGA, VGA require at least 256k of Video memory).

install your mouse).
