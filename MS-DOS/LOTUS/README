Lotus The Ultimate Challenge is best played using joystick or mouse.

We recommend that players wishing to play the game using the keyboard read
the text below.

A small number of keyboards may cause problems when 3 keys or more are held
down simultaneously. Certain key combinations may cause a problem where a
certain key/s don't respond during a race. This is due to hardware
restrictions.

A single player experiencing this problem would be advised to choose automatic
gears so that only turning left/right and accelerate are used during the race.
If a single player wishes to use manual gears and experiences this problem then
they should try different keyboard combinations by re-defining their keys.

If 2 players wish to use the keyboard during a race and experience the
difficulty explained above then we recommend that the players try different
keyboard combinations by re-defining their keys until this problem no longer
occurs.
