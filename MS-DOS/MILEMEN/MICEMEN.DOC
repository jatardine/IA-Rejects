                             * Objective *

      The object of Mice Men is to get all twelve of your color mice
      to the other end of the game board before your opponent does.
      In this version you will always be playing the blue mice and the
      computer will play the red mice.



                         * Setting Difficulty *

      At the opening screen, the game will ask you for the difficulty
      level of play.    <H>ard  <M>edium  <E>asy

      The computer will then randomly decide who will take the first
      turn.


                                 * Play *
 
      The game board consists of 19 columns and 13 rows of various cheese
      blocks.  At the start of play, the blue mice are located on the
      left side of the cheese board and the red mice are on the right.
      When it is your turn to play, special pushing poles will be shown
      at the bottom of those columns where you have mice located. Using
      your left and right arrow keys you can select the column you want.

      You can either push or pull the column up or down.  This will
      shift the entire column in that direction.  It will wrap around,
      so that if you have a mouse at the top of the cheese board and you
      push the column up, the mouse will now appear at the bottom.
      If it's a the bottom and you pull the column down, then it appears
      at the top.

      By pulling and pushing columns of cheese blocks, you can create
      passageways for your mice so that they can reach the right side
      of the cheese board.  The red mice are trying to get all the way
      to the left side.  After a column has been pushed, that player's
      mice move as far as they can within the maze.  When they can't
      move any further, the opponent's mice will then move if they can.

      Each side takes turns pushing and pulling columns of cheese blocks
      until one player has gotten all twelve of his mice off the game
      board.


                         * Columns Locked Out *

      There are times when you will not be allowed to select a column
      even though you have mice located in it.  When you have pushed
      the same column a total of 6 times in a row, it will not allow
      you to push or pull that column again until you've pushed one
      of the others.  This is not the case if you have only one possible
      column to push.

      Any column that has been pushed by an opponent on the previous turn
      is also locked out for the next turn.  A column that has been locked
      out will have a yellow 'X' over the pole.


                             * Win/Loss/Draw *

      The first player to get his twelve mice off the cheese board will
      be declared the winner.  If each player has only one mouse left
      on the cheese board, then there will be only 8 moves left for each
      player.  The mouse that's further along in the cheese board will be
      the winner.  If both mice are exactly the same distance, then the
      game will be declared a draw.  The game will warn you with 5 moves
      left that the game will end if no one has won by that time.


                               * Keys *

           Arrow Keys Left/Right  :   Select Column
           Arrow Keys   Up/Down   :   Pushes/Pulls Column

                      <N>ew Game  :   Starts new game
                      <S>ound     :   Toggles Sound On/Off
                      <C>olors    :   Changes default colors of Cheese & Mice
                                      (For Laptop Players with Mono Screens)
                      <L>oad      :   Loads a previously saved game
                      <S>ave      :   Saves a game to be loaded later
                      <Q>uit      :   Quit Mice Men Program


        The Key Definitions are shown at the bottom of the board at
        all times.

        Mice Men is easy to play, yet will involve a lot of strategy on
        your part in order to win, especially at the Hardest level of play.
        Each game board will be different, so no two games will ever be the
        same!
