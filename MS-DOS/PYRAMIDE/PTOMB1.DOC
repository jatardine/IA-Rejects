   If you like this game there are three sequels you can also order to
   continue your adventure.  Please pass this game around to friends if
   you want to.

   Use the [Ctrl] and [Alt] keys to move your man left and right, press
   the [spacebar] to jump, and any key on the bottom row throws a spear!
   The left/right movement keys can be redefined if not workable on your
   particular keyboard.  Please use the Configure option from the menu.

   Caution:  This game may not work correctly if you are also running
   RAM resident software such as SideKick, which uses similar hot keys
   to the left/right movement keys of Pharaoh's Tomb.

   Thank you,
