This subrepo includes a variety of MS-DOS games, mostly in German and all originating from a single CD-RW I received from my uncle (RIP). I decided to keep this disc's directory structure and only excluded the following subdirectories:

INDY (identical to INDYCAR)
LEMMINGS (identical to LEM)

One directory may require a new name as it currently consists of the N-word in German. Alternatively I'll publish it with its original name and include a disclaimer.
