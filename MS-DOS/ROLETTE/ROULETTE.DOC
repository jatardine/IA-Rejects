                         VGA Roulette 2.0

VGA Roulette Version 2.0 is a game program that simulates the popular
betting game just like Las Vegas.  VGA Roulette is another shareware
program from the VGA Fun Pak collection from JSSJ Software.  If you do not
have the VGA Fun Pak, it should be available on your BBS shortly.  As
indicated by its name VGA Roulette requires a VGA Display.  In addition,
you must have a Microsoft-compatible mouse to run this program.  (Note:
Some problems have been reported with the Mouse System Mouse which is only
Microsoft-compatible if loaded with a /m flag.)

ROULETTE.EXE provides a very graphic and colorful screen that looks like
a real roulette table (except for the wheel).  The screen is divided into
six areas; (1) the Roulette Table, (2) the Command Lines, (3) the Clock,
(4) the WHEEL, (5) the Scoreboard, and (6) the Message Area.  The Clock
displays the current time and is for information only (can't miss lunch). 
All bets and commands are entered using the mouse.  There are no
complicated meanings to the mouse buttons as in some programs, any or all
buttons simply mean SELECT.  Bets or commands can be selected by pointing
to the bet location or command and pressing any or all of the mouse
buttons.

INSTALLATION

There are two ways to install and use VGA Roulette.  It will work stand-
alone by just copying the ROULETTE.EXE program to an appropriate disk or
directory.  The ZIP file that ROULETTE.EXE was distributed in also
contains a file called ROULETTE.INS.  This will install the program in the
VGA Fun Pak (VFP) menu system.  Just type VFPMENU [Enter], select the
install option and follow the instructions in the VGA Fun Pak manual.

STARTING ROULETTE.EXE

VGA Roulette is started by typing ROULETTE[.EXE] or by selecting "VGA
Roulette" from the VFP menu.  When the program starts you may or may not
see the shareware message first (see SHAREWARE below.)  The screen will
then be drawn and the message area will display a prompt for your
initials.  Enter your initials carefully as the program maintains a
running account of your financial status in the ROULETTE.DAT file, along
with a password to protect your stake.  After entering your initials, the
program looks in the ROULETTE.DAT file to see if you have played before. 
If your initials are found, the program will prompt for your password. 
DON'T FORGET YOUR PASSWORD OR YOUR FINANCIAL ACCOUNT WILL BE LOST! (If
your financial condition gets so bad that it embarrasses you, delete the
ROULETTE,DAT file and start fresh!)  If your initials are not found, you
are prompted to check to see that you entered the initials correctly
before being asked for your password.  After entering your password
correctly, you may proceed to play Roulette.  You are given three chances
to get your password correct.  After three tries, the program terminates.PLACING BETS

Placing bets involves three areas of the screen: the Roulette Table, the
Command Area, and the Scoreboard.  Bets may be placed on the table in
three denominations: $100, $250 and $500.  These are represented by
betting chips and are selected by pointing at the desired denomination on
the second command line and selecting (by pressing a mouse button) it. 
The scoreboard always displays the currently selected chip in the lower
right-hand corner next to the WHEEL.

You may place up to 20 bets on the board.  Bet locations are designated by
colored circles on the table, and all standard Roulette bets are indicated
on the board.  Multiple bets at a single location may be placed by holding
the mouse button down.  Bets are paced at about 5 bets per second, so that
with a little practice, you can place your bets quickly.  After you have
placed you 20th bet the WHEEL begins to spin automatically.  If you wish
to make fewer than 20 bets, just select the NO MORE BETS option on the
first command line.  The WHEEL will "spin" and the computer will award any
payoffs.  To simplify matters, the computer reduces your stake as you make
bets, and pays off at the appropriate odds plus your original bet.  Thus
a winning $100 bet on the number 12 would pay $3,600 (35:1 odds plus your
bet.)  Current bet amounts and totals are displayed on the Scoreboard. 
VGA Roulette will display your bets and the MARKER (designating the
winning number) until you "PRESS MOUSE TO CONTINUE", as instructed by the
message which has replaced the NO MORE BETS option.  This provides you
time to evaluate your bets and how you won (or lost).

COMMANDS

There are three other commands, QUIT, SOUND ON (OFF) and ODDS displayed on
the second command line.  QUIT is the way you exit the game.  If you
select QUIT you are prompted in the message area to validate the
selection.  Just select the YES option to exit or the NO option to
continue to play.

SOUND ON (OFF) is a toggle that displays the current status of sound
either on or off.  Selecting this command when sound is on will turn sound
off and vice versa.  In addition to the visual verification, toggling
SOUND ON also provide an audible beep.  

The ODDS command displays a window with the odds and colors that represent
the specific bets.  This is sort of a help key to assist those less
familiar with playing Roulette.  As you can tell this manual is not an
instruction book for the game itself.  If you are new to Roulette, I
suggest that you write a casino in Las Vegas, Reno or Lake Tahoe for
instructions.  Casinos generally supply rules to all their games free of
charge in the hopes that you will eventually pay the back with a visit.

SCOREBOARD

The Scoreboard displays information about your financial condition.  When
you first start to play, the HOUSE gives you a $25,000 stake as a VIP to
play with.  (Tell 'em Telly sent you!)  After that is gone, you are issued
MARKERS in amounts of $10,000.  Winning $1,000,000 breaks the BANK and
reduces your stake to the original $25,000.  Losing $1,000,000 will cause
you to bankrupt and your markers are written off.  You may continue to
play on a fresh $25,000.

The top line of the Scoreboard displays your current status (STAKE,
WON/(LOST) this session, total bets and MARKERS.  The second line indicate
the status of the current bet including number of bets, bet amount,
winning number, and winning amount.
