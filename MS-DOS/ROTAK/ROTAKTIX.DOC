                             INTRODUCTION

ROTAKTIX  is a game of luck, strategy and concentration.  Played  on  a
game  board that has nine vertical columns, or 'wells'.  Each  well  is
deep  enough  to hold 7 game play pieces, or "tokens", hence  the  game
board  will contain a maximum of 63 tokens.  During play, tokens appear
at  the  top  of the game board in a row of 9.  The tokens are  rotated
left  or  right  using the arrow keys until they are  in  position  for
maximum  scoring, and then dropped into play by pressing the  spacebar.
The  amount of time you have to decide the best position, and then drop
the  tokens  into play is determined by the level you are  playing  and
shown  as  a "count down" timer on the info section of the game  board.
If  this timer reaches zero before you have dropped the tokens, it will
drop  the tokens automatically, at their current position.  One of  the
most  dynamic and challenging aspects of ROTAKTIX is that all 9  tokens
are  dropped at the same time, sometimes blocking or covering  up  good
scoring possibilities.

Scoring  is  based on matching the tokens, by color, in  groups  of  3,
either  horizontal, vertical or diagonal. These groupings are  referred
to as "runs".   When a run is scored, those tokens are removed from the
game board, and any remaining tokens, fall down to fill in where scored
tokens  have  been removed.  This falling and filling in can  have  the
effect  of  creating even further runs to be scored, sort  of  a  chain
reaction.

Each  level in ROTAKTIX is played as a series of 3 goal rounds  plus  a
bonus  round.  In the first round, you are required to make  a  certain
number  of  horizontal runs in order to pass that  round.   Other  runs
still  score, but are not counted towards the round's goal.  The second
goal round is vertical runs and the third diagonal.  The last round  of
a  level is the bonus round, this round has no goal other than to  make
the  most runs possible within a time limit  set by the level  you  are
playing.  The time limit gets larger in proportion to the level so  you
have  more time to make a larger score.  In addition, scoring is  based
on  a  multiple of the level you are playing, so going to higher rounds
means  a larger score.  In the bonus round, the score for the round  is
not  added  directly  in,  but is held and accumulated  throughout  the
round.  At the end of the round, the accumulated score is multiplied by
the  number  of  runs for that round.  Thus, it is  most  desirable  to
advance to bonus rounds to accumulate truly massive scores.

While  going  to  higher levels is desirable scoring wise,  it  can  be
undesirable  as  well, because at each new level  an  additional  token
color is added to the mix, making gameplay much more difficult.  At the
end  of the 10th level of play the number of colors and the goals  will
be  reset  back  to their first level settings and you  will  have  the
opportunity   to   play  through  another  series  of  10   level/round
combinations.   The score will continue to build and  the  level  count
will continue to rise all the while.

The game continues in this manner until the entire game board is filled
with  tokens  and no more can be dropped into play, or if you  manually
quit  the  game.  Your score will then be compared to the  high  scores
saved from previous games and you might be given an opportunity to  add
your name to the list of all time high scores.


                                SCORING

Scoring in ROTAKTIX is calculated using the following formula:

  SCORE =  # OF TOKENS x 50 POINTS(PER TOKEN) x LEVEL

so for an example, you get 3 runs on a drop, 1 horizontal, 1 vertical
and 1 diagonal, on level 1:

  horizontal   =    3 x 50 x 1      =   150
  vertical     =    3 x 50 x 1      =   150
  diagonal     =    3 x 50 x 1      =   150
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  for a total of                        450

A token can be part of more than one run.  It might appear as though
runs of 4 or 5 like tokens are being scored, but in reality what is
happening is that 2, 3, 4 or more runs (of 3) that share common tokens
are being scored.

Wild tokens will appear now and then, and they can match any other
token to make runs, though they score the same as regular tokens.  An
example of a nice use of wild tokens would be to have 2 reds and 2
greens separated by an open slot, you drop a wild one in to the open
slot to make 2 runs, one red and one green.


                             GAME CONTROLS
                                   
LEFT ARROW KEY    =   ROTATE TOKENS LEFT
RIGHT ARROW KEY   =   ROTATE TOKENS RIGHT
SPACEBAR  =  DROP TOKENS INTO PLAY
T  =  TOGGLE SOUND FX ON/OFF
S  =  SWAP TOKEN SETS
G  =  TOGGLE GOAL DISPLAYS ON/OFF
ESC  =  QUIT THE GAME
F1  =  ON-LINE HELP SCREENS

                             HINTS & TIPS

In the goal rounds, take your time and look for the best scoring
possibilities.  In the bonus rounds, try to go as fast as you can.
Scoring in the bonus round is based on the number of runs.  Be sure not
to fill up the game board though as doing this at any time during the
game, will end the game.  For maximum score, avoid making the goal for
as long as possible to score higher at lower levels, again be sure not
to fill up the game board.  Look for multiple runs on a drop.  Look for
chain reaction scoring, i.e.: runs that will be made as a result of
tokens falling and filling in where scored tokens have been removed.



                          INSTALLING ROTAKTIX

While ROTAKTIX does not require hard drive installation, it is highly
recommended as it will pause for extended periods during gameplay if
played from floppy.  Always use a backup copy of the ROTAKTIX master
disk if playing from floppy.

To install ROTAKTIX, place the master disk in the appropriate drive,
connect to that drive and type 'INSTALL' and press return.  The
installation program will ask you the appropriate information.
