                       Release 3.0   December 8, 1993

Most people seem to enjoy trying to hit a target. Whether it's tossing a
ball through a hoop, trying to shoot cans off a fence, or blasting space
aliens on a computer screen, there's something about it that's FUN!

"Shooting Gallery" is an attempt to recreate a shooting range on a
computer screen. It originally started as just a target shoot as you
might find at a carnival, but even before I had that done I had ideas
for other rounds. This version has seven rounds (actually two different
variations on each of three ideas plus a final completely different
round).

Shooting Gallery shouldn't require much instruction to play. It works,
basically, on the concept: "if it moves, shoot it!". Rather than reading
all the way through the instructions, just play a few games and then
come back for some tips on how to maximize your scores. There is help at
the title screen and each round uses a portion of the screen to give you
point values or tips.

Shooting Gallery runs in 320x200, 256 color MCGA graphics, thus an MCGA
or VGA video card and monitor is needed; Shooting Gallery will not run
on CGA or EGA systems and I have no plans to convert it so that it will.
It also requires a mouse.

Shooting Gallery also now supports SoundBlaster (and compatible) sound
cards with digitized sound effects on all rounds. To use this feature
you must have a minimum of about 470,000 bytes of free conventional
memory (the low 640k of memory, expanded or extended memory does not
count). To get all possible sound effects you need about 495,000 bytes
free. With all the great memory management tools available these days
this shouldn't be much of a problem. Please note: the shareware version
is distributed with only a sample sound effects file, to save on
download or disk space. The sound effects file in the registered version
is much larger with many more effects! One side effect of this is that
the shareware version has smaller memory requirements.

Shooting Gallery is distributed as Shareware -- this allows you to try
it before you buy it, but if you continue to use the game you are
expected to register. When you register, please let me know what version
you have (it's right on the title screen) and I'd also be interested to
know where you got it from. Please, make sure you put your name and
address on your letter! Or you can use the instant registration form in
the file "ORDERFRM.TXT". Just copy the file to your printer, fill it
out, and mail it. If you're not familiar with the Shareware concept,
please read the file "SHAREWRE.TXT". Registration is $15, for which I
will send you a disk with the latest version, with the shareware
reminders removed and including the complete (and much larger!) sound
effects library for sound card users. Or for $22 you can get the
"deluxe" version which includes a copy of the latest version of the game
in a binder with printed instructions. Shipping and handling is $2, or
$4 for outside North America or for the deluxe version.

If you live in the U.K. you can register through Nildram Software.
Please print the file "UKORDER.TXT" for an order form all ready to go or
just send #12.95 to:

If you have any suggestions or discover any problems with the program
you can reach me via the Xevious BBS (PCBoard) system (300 thru 16800
bps, HST/v.32, 8N1) at 508-875-3618. Leave a C)omment to the sysop to
reach me. Xevious is the official support BBS for all my software and
the latest versions are always available for downloading there. There is
also a support conference for people to exchange game tips or ask
questions. J)oin conference #31 and check out the latest tips. Also
check B)ulletin #1 for the list of latest versions of all my software.

You can also reach Xevious through RelayNet. If there's a RelayNet board
in your area send a routed message to me at node XEVIOUS. The Shareware
conference would be the best choice, but if that's not available try

*****************************************************************************


OBJECT:

The object varies with each round, but in general you want to hit the
targets as quickly as possible. Each round is described individually
below. Even if you decide you don't like the game, please don't shoot
the programmer!


GENERAL:

If you need to you can abort the current round at any time by hitting
the ESC key. Hitting Alt-X will quickly exit the game without going
through the menu screen. Rounds 1, 4 and 7 can also be paused by hitting
the space key; the other rounds already have natural pauses in them.


ROUND 1:

This is a version of the carnival shooting booth. Different targets have
different point values, as shown at the bottom of the screen. In
addition, there is a bonus for hitting something on the faster moving
rows: 10 extra points for the top row, and 5 extra points for the middle
row.

Make sure to hit the extra ammo and extra time boxes whenever they
appear to keep the round going longer.

The best way to maximize points is by hitting a whole row of the same
target type. The number of targets in a row varies from 4 to 8, and the
bonuses vary from 200 to 500:

    Target Description   Number in a Row   Bonus Value
    ------------------   ---------------   -----------
    Duck                        8              300
    Spinning Wheel              8              200
    Squirrel                    6              300
    Clay Pipe                   8              300
    Wine Bottle                 6              300
    Soda Can                    8              300
    Beer Bottle                 4              400
    Pinwheel                    6              300
    Fruit                       6              200
    Heart                       6              200
    Smiley Face                 8              200
    Coffee Mug                  6              200
    Candle                      4              500

If you need to pause the round, just hit the space bar on your keyboard.
Click the mouse to restart.

The game should set the speed of the targets correctly, but if you wish
to speed up or slow down you can use the < and > keys to change the
target speed.

ROUND 2:

This round requires hitting a "clay pigeon", a target that is tossed off
into the distance that you try to hit with a shotgun. The target moves
quickly and so rapidly grows smaller and harder to hit. For best
results, try to aim a little ahead of the target; it takes a while for
the shot to reach it through the distance!

No points are given for a miss. When you hit, the score is based on how
quickly you hit the target. See the upper right part of the scoreboard
for your time.

ROUND 3:

In this round you must quick draw against a target. Watch the timing
lights and when they turn green, draw your "Rodent .45" from its
holster, aim at the center of the target and fire!

Your score is based on both your time and how close you got to the exact
center of the target. See the upper right part of the scoreboard for
your time.

ROUND 4:

This is like Round 1, but with a few complications added. All the
targets have changed, and their point values have, in general, doubled.
The bonuses for hitting targets on the faster moving rows have doubled
as well.

To make things more complicated, the targets will change direction at
random times. Also, there's a special target labelled "HIT ME". Do what
the target says! If you don't hit it before it scrolls off the screen
there is a 500 point penalty.

As in Round 1, the best way to get a top score is by hitting a whole row
of the same target. In this round, the number of targets in a row varies
from 4 to 8, and the bonuses vary from 600 to 1000:

    Target Description   Number in a Row   Bonus Value
    ------------------   ---------------   -----------
    Bell                        8              600
    Flower                      6              800
    Baseball                    8              600
    Bomb                        4              600
    Alarm Clock                 6              600
    Beer Bottle                 4             1000
    Diskette                    8              600
    Shield                      6              800
    Chicken                     5              800
    Flowers                     6              800
    Stein                       6              600
    Wreath                      5              800

If you need to pause the round, just hit the space bar on your keyboard.
Click the mouse to restart.

The game should set the speed of the targets correctly, but if you wish
to speed up or slow down you can use the < and > keys to change the
target speed.

ROUND 5:

Once again you're at the skeet shooting range as in round 2. This time,
though, you're equipped with a double barrel shotgun and you'll have two
clay pigeons to hit each time.

You're given points for each target you hit, even if you hit only one
out of two. Your time, though, is always based on the time it takes to
make both shots. Shoot fast for the highest score.

ROUND 6:

As in Round 3 you must quick draw against a target. This time, though,
there are two targets to hit. HIT THE LEFT TARGET FIRST!

You are scored separately on the accuracy of each shot, but your time is
your total time for both shots.

ROUND 7:

Suddenly you find yourself back in the wild west and your town has been
invaded by a gang of bad guys, all wearing dark hats! The object of this
round is to finish off all the bad guys without shooting the townspeople.

You have a limited amount of ammunition and time before the bad guys
take over for good. Each bad guy shot will earn you 100 points. Finish
off all 40 or more bad guys in time and earn an additional 100 point
bonus for each second of time remaining.

However, unlike the other rounds, these targets shoot back! Lose two
seconds for each shot the bad guys get off. Also, if you hit one of the
townspeople you lose 200 points and two rounds of ammo.

Good luck, cowboy!


GAME OPTIONS:

The title screen provides a number of options. In addition to going
straight into the game you can practice any one round, see the high
score hall of fame, get some help, etc.

Help:

If you've read this far into the docs you probably don't need any more
help, but these screens can be used as a quick reminder of what each
round is. At each help screen you have the option of going on to the
next screen, going back to the previous screen, or quitting help.

Info:

Some basic information on Shooting Gallery and how to register.

Option:

This displays the option menu which includes several items:

Show Scores: View the high scores hall of fame. The high scores are also
shown at the end of each game. Click to exit the hall of fame.

Enable (Disable) PC Speaker Sounds: This toggles sound effects played
through the PC speaker on and off. This only affects the sound effects
during game play. You cannot have both PC speaker sounds and
SoundBlaster sounds enabled at the same time.

Enable (Disable) SoundBlaster Sounds: This toggles sound effects played
through your sound card on and off. This only affects the sound effects
during game play. You cannot have both SoundBlaster sounds and PC
speaker sounds enabled at the same time.

Turn Music Off (On): This toggles music played through the PC speaker on
and off. This only affects the music on the title screen and in Round 7.

Clear High Scores: This option resets all the high scores in the hall of
fame and individual rounds. You can also do this by deleting the high
scores file "SHOOT.SCR".

Turn Practice Limits Off (On): Turning limits off allows you to practice
any round for as long as you wish without your ammo or time running out.

Select Players: Use this function to select up to four people for a
multi-player game. Click on the push buttons to select/deselect players.
When you select a player by pushing a button in you must then enter the
player's name. You can use backspace to correct errors if necessary and
you must hit the Enter key when done. When this option is used each
player will have a chance at each round before going on to the next one.

Select Rounds: This function lets you select which of the available
rounds you wish to play. Click on the push buttons next to the names of
the rounds to select/deselect. Push the button in to select the round.

Single Player: Undoes the Select Players function and returns to a
normal single player game.

Play All Rounds: Undoes the Select Rounds function and returns to games
where you play all the rounds.

Practice:

This brings up a list of all the different rounds available. Point to
the button next to the round you want to practice and then click. If you
want to practice a round for an unlimited amount of time use the Turn
Practice Limits Off setting under the Options menu.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:

There are several options when starting up the game. Some people play in
an environment where quiet is necessary so it's possible to play with
the sound off. Add a " -s" to the command line to turn all sounds off.
You can also selectively control music and sound effects. Add " -m" to
the command line to turn off music. Add " -e" to turn off sound effects.

Also, on some systems the VGA card is not detected properly and early
versions of Shooting Gallery failed to run. If you're sure your system
supports MCGA or VGA graphics yet fails to run, use the " -v" (no video
detection) option on the command line and Shooting Gallery will run
without checking your video card type. NOTICE: If you don't have VGA on
your system using this option will not make the game work. You must have
VGA graphics on your system to use Shooting Gallery.

One of the options lets you practice the rounds as long as you like--in
other words, the timer and ammo limits are disabled. You can also set
this option from the command line using the " -n" (no limits) option.

Since command line options are confusing to some people, here are
examples of how to use them. To turn the sound off, your command line
should look like this:

                                  shoot -s

To disable video card detection, your command line would look like this:

                                  shoot -v

Finally, you can use several options at the same time. To play with the
sound off and no limits on practice the command line would look like
this:

                                shoot -s -n
