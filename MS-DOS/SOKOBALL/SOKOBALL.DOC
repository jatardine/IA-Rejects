What is Sokoball?

Sokoball is my version of the Sokoban puzzles you may have seen in the past.
Sokoban is Japanese for "warehouse man".  In Sokoban puzzles you must generally
push a number of boxes around the screen to a designated position.  The key
word here is push.  In Sokoban puzzles that is the only way you can move any
box.  You must push it to its' destination.  Sokoball abides by this rule as
well (in most cases). 


What's the object of the Sokoball game?

Clear all of the boxes from the board by pushing them down the exit shafts.
You are not under the gun of a clock or any number of moves.  You simply must
clear all boxes from the board to "beat" or solve the puzzle.  I like the word
beat.


What are the differences between Sokoball and Sokoban?

All of the Sokoban games that I have seen have offered a number of puzzles or
levels that you had complete in succession.  In addition, they all required
you to simply get the boxes to a designated area with the only hazards being
moving your boxes into a corner or creating a pile of boxes which you could not
move.  In Sokoban you can only push one box at a time and you can only push the
boxes across a totally empty floor tile.  Sokoball follows this tradition.


Now the neat stuff....

I wanted to add  some additional hazards and obstacles to overcome in Sokoball,
such as one way streets, pop-up barriers and floor plans that change when you
cross certain floor tiles.  I didn't want to force anyone to complete a series
of puzzles in a specific order. In Sokoball you can play any puzzle you wish
at any time.  If a certain Sokoball puzzle has you stumped, give it a rest and
come back to it later.  In the meantime, how about solving that puzzle your
co-worker created and bet you 10 bucks you couldn't solve.  That's right, with
Sokoball you can create your own puzzles...it comes with an Editor so you can
edit and create your own diabolical puzzles for those know-it-alls you work
with to solve.


How do you move?

All movements on the game board are by using the cursor control keys.
Sokoball is not mouse aware and there are no plans to bring rodents into
the game.  


Game Tips

In Sokoball you will have to think about future moves all of the time, unless
you create some really dumb puzzles!  You will generally have to move boxes in
a certain order.  You will often have to activate one or more of the slider
tiles to make a box accessable but be careful, do it to late or to soon and
you are stuck.

Never push a box in a corner unless you have a way to get it out again.
Boxes can only be pushed on totally plain tiles and only one box can be pushed
at a time.



Sokoball ShareWare  or  Sokoball Commercial...which to choose?

Sokoball is being released as ShareWare.  This means that you may freely copy
and distribute it for non-commercial purposes.  You may copy it for your
friends, you may upload it to bulletin boards, you can even send $10 to me if
you like Sokoball and want the non ShareWare version.  Huh? 

That's right, there is a commercial version of Sokoball.  While the ShareWare
version will allow you to create original Sokoban type puzzles it will not let
you have access to all the neat features I have added to the Editor.

If you send your $10 registration fee you'll get all the new gizmos for the
Sokoball Editor plus the ability to make your Sokoball puzzles un-editable
by others.  I'll send you the latest non-ShareWare version of Sokoball on your
choice of diskettes, a manual and any new puzzles that have been contributed.

To Register and receive the Non-ShareWare version of Sokoball......

It's my hope that many of you will create some really neat Sokoball puzzle
boards and upload them to CompuServe, America OnLine, Etc.  I enjoy solving 
these things but I don't like solving the ones I created.  Come on, hit me
with your best shot.  This is why I designed Sokoball so you could work on
any puzzle you choose instead of having to go through levels.   But PLEASE,
don't upload any puzzle that can't be solved.  Many of the Sokoball puzzles
appear to be impossible to solve at first glance.

Whether you register or not I hope you enjoy Sokoball.  I enjoyed writing it.
Sokoball was written in QuickBasic 4.5.   I used the game development to learn
more about graphics in the basic language for another project I was working on.
Enjoy.
