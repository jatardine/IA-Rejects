The following files should be on your Mah Jongg -V-G-A- disk:



MJVGA.EXE -- The program!!  It won't work without this one!!!  

MJVGA.DOC -- Tme manual.  Not vital, but nice to have!

FILES.TXT -- You're reading it, so it must be there!!!

V00  .ICN -- Graphic icon files.  If even one of the 55 files is
  thru       missing, Mah Jongg -V-G-A- will complain and refuse
V54  .ICN    to run.

PAL  .CFG -- Color palette file.  If this is missing, Mah Jongg
	     -V-G-A- will run, but the colors will be bizarre!!


If you give a copy of this program to anyone, PLEASE be sure that
all of the files are on the disk!!!  Thanks!!!
