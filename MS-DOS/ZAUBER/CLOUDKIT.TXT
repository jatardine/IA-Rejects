                CLOUDKIT.ZIP contains (6) files:
                CLOUDKIT.TXT - This text file
                USCLOUDS.SC1 - ASD file containing clutters of clouds
                CLOUD.RPT    - SEE04 process file
                CLOUD.DAT    - SEE04 data file
                CLOUD.SC0    - SEE04 "Large cloud for high altitudes"
                CLOUD1.SC0   - SEE04 "Small cloud for low altitudes"

      USCLOUDS.SC1 was created with SubLOGIC's Instrument Pilot Scenery in
mind.  This ASD file will blanket your FS4 flying environment from coast to
coast with multi-layers of randomly appearing unpredictable cloud polygons.
The SEE04 files are included should you desire too thin'em out a little or
reconfigure altitudes of the various layers.
      The whole concept of USCLOUDS is simple yet effective.  How often have you had your destination field in sight from 10 miles out only to have it obscurred from view by clouds during your descent stage!  Remember the rules.
If you're not on an IFR plan, you'd better remain clear of clouds.
      DataWings thanks Laemming Wheeler for his creative inputs during
the CPAA conference in Ithaca.  USCLOUDS is merge friendly at only 7781 bytes and borderless from East Coast to West.  Note that USCLOUDS covers the
entire United States and may take priority over your smaller localized areas
of ASD coverage in the static scenery auto-load.  You might want to run with
manual scenery select only, merge clouds with your localized scenery or
modify the boundaries of the cloud files to avoid any conflict.  What ever
method you choose, DataWings wishes you a pleasant PC flight through these
slightly more challenging skies.  Enjoy USCLOUDS!
