                                    INTRODUCTION
          
              Welcome to F.Godmom!  F.Godmom is an arcade/puzzle game 
          written by John Blackwell and presented by Soggybread Software.
              In F.Godmom you play a fairy godmother on a mission to free 
          fifty of your fellow fairy godmothers.  Armed with a magic wand 
          of transformation, you must solve the puzzles on fifty levels 
          while avoiding killer crabs and dangerous dimensional implosions.  
          If you succeed, you will see your fellow fairy godmothers freed 
          and they will dance for joy in your honor.  If not, it's curtains 
          for you.
              This manual contains complete instructions to help you get 
          started.  The manual also contains information on how to play the 
          game, control the fairy, use the games features (such as the boss 
          key and on-line help), and register your copy.
              Good luck and have fun!
          
          
                                      FEATURES
          
          F.Godmom comes with many special features:
              SHAREWARE You can legally give copies of F.Godmom to your 
                  friends or upload it to your favorite bulletin board.  In  
                  fact, I encourage you to give it away.  Feel free to take  
                  this game to work (see BOSS KEY below) and give copies to  
                  your co-workers or onto campus to give to your fellow      
                  students.  Shareware is truly one of the few things that   
                  you can give to someone else and still possess yourself.   
                  (see the LICENSE STATEMENT for the details of how the      
                  game can be distributed)
              ANIMATED GRAPHICS which operate on CGA, EGA and VGA monitors.
                  graphics systems. (see GRAPHICS COMPATIBILITY)
              FIFTY BUILT-IN LEVELS filled with puzzles, hidden pictures 
                  and hidden messages.
              ON-LINE HELP to tell you how to play the game, what keys to    
                  press and even how to get past the first level.  (see      
                  GAME CONTROLS)
              SAVE/RESTORE lets you have up to nine different games in       
                  progress and finish them at your convenience.  Used        
                  correctly, this feature can help you avoid losing lives.   
                  You merely have to save your game after you complete each  
                  level.  Then, if you lose a life, you can restore the      
                  game to get that life back. (see GAME CONTROLS)
              PAUSE lets you freeze the game until you are ready to          
                  continue.  (While you are in pause mode, you can press     
                  <P> again, causing the program to continue and then        
                  immediately repause.  In this way you can run the game     
                  frame-by-frame.)  (see GAME CONTROLS)
              BOSS KEY lets you camouflage the game with a fake DOS 
                  screen.  This feature is for when the boss comes around    
                  while you are playing the game at work.  (You should be    
                  ashamed of yourself.)  (see GAME CONTROLS)

              THE DANCE OF JOY.  If you finish all fifty levels of           
                  F.Godmom, you will see the fairies freed and their dance   
                  of joy (complete with music) in your honor.  (see *FREE*   
                  STUFF)
          
          
                             NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 4.0
          
          F.Godmom 4.0 also come with some new features:
              NEW GRAPHICS:  F.Godmom now sports beautiful new graphics,     
                  thanks to Tom Hall and Adrian "Master of the Pixel"        
                  Carmack of Id Software.  If you have one of their          
                  Commander Keen games and are still looking for one more    
                  reason to register it, do it because they are incredibly   
                  nice guys.
              BETTER KEYBOARD RESPONSE:  The fairy corners like a Ferrari    
                  now (with no annoying pauses), and once again I have to    
                  thank the fine folks at Id Software.
              GRAPHICAL MENUS AND HELP:  OK, Tom Hall did suggest this,      
                  but I did the actual work.
              VARIABLE SPEED CRABS:  Now you slower game players can speed-  
                  up or slow-down the crabs with the press of a key.
              EASIER LEVELS:  I've taken some of the crabs out of the early  
                  levels.  (Please don't applaud, just send money.)
          
          
                                COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
          
              Command-line options are codes that you add to the command 
          line when you start the program.  Using these codes, you can 
          start the game just the way you like it.
          
          Here is a list of the command line options:
               CGA : Use CGA graphics.
               FIP : Freeze implosions until key pressed.
               JOY : Use joystick controls.
              KEYB : Use keyboard controls.
            RULES- : Skip the rules.
            SAVE:n : Save and restore from position #n. (n is 1-9.)
           SLOCRAB : Start the game with the crabs set to half speed.
              SND+ : Start the game with sound.
              SND- : Start the game without sound.
          
              Say, for example, that you wanted the program to 
          automatically save your games to position #5, start with sound, 
          skip the rules and use the keyboard controls.  Instead of 
          starting the game with the command "FGODMOM", you would start the 
          game with this command: "FGODMOM SAVE:5 SND+ RULES- KEYB".
          
          
                               GRAPHICS COMPATIBILITY
          
              F.Godmom was written for PCs, ATs and XTs with CGA, EGA or 
          VGA monitors.  There is the possibility, however, that the game

          EGA monochrome, or Hercules with CGA emulation.
              Note, though, that the game has only been tested on CGA, EGA 
          and VGA monitors.  I make no guarantees about how the game will 
          work with any other type of monitor.

                               THE OBJECT OF F.GODMOM
          
              The object of F.Godmom is to finish all fifty levels to free 
          your fellow fairy godmothers.  To finish a level, you must 
          collect seven pennies and the key.  After you collect seven 
          pennies, the exit door will appear (unless the space where the 
          exit door is to appear is occupied by another object.)  Once you 
          reach the exit door with the key, the level is complete, and you 
          move on to the next level.  When you complete all fifty levels, 
          the fairies will celebrate in your honor with music and dancing.
          
          
                                      THE WAND
          
              Your only weapon is a wand of transformation.  This wand 
          allows you to transform objects for five seconds.  First you must 
          scan the pattern of an object (like taking its picture) by 
          pressing the <Ctrl> key (or any key on the bottom row of the 
          keyboard.)  The pattern you have scanned will then appear in your 
          WAND PATTERN box at the bottom of the screen to show you what 
          pattern your wand contains.  You can then project that pattern 
          onto other objects by pressing the <Ctrl> key or the <Space bar>.  
          Transformed objects will stay that way for five seconds.  At the 
          end of five seconds, the objects will go back to normal.
              For example: If you want to change a brick wall to a ladder, 
          you should first face the ladder and press the <B> key.  A 
          picture of a ladder will then appear in your WAND PATTERN box.  
          Face the brick wall and press the space bar.  In a flash the 
          brick wall should transform to a ladder.  At the end of five 
          seconds, the ladder will change back to brick.
              Note: 1) The wand does not work on objects made of iron.  You 
          can neither scan nor project the pattern of an iron wall or an 
          iron ladder. 2) You can fire the wand to the left and right only.
          
          
                                      THE CRABS
          
              As you make your way through the levels, you must be careful 
          not to be nabbed by the crabs.  The crabs are stupid and cannot 
          run faster than you, but if they touch you, they caught you.
              Note: The crabs are deathly afraid of heights and will not 
          willingly follow you off of a ledge.  In fact, the crabs have 
          such a fear of heights that they will not step out over a gap in 
          the floor, even if there is a ladder to climb onto.  This fact is 
          important to the completion of several of the levels.

                                     IMPLOSIONS
          
              Sometimes, objects disappear in a flash of light.  This 
          happens when two objects try to occupy the same space.  For 
          example, if you try to transform a crab to a ladder while the 
          crab overlaps another ladder, there will be two ladders in the 
          same space (where the ladders overlap).  Because two objects 
          cannot exist in the same space, This overlap causes a small tear 
          in reality (trust me), and some objects may be sucked away (an 
          implosion).  The best way to see what an implosion does is to 
          create one.  An implosion is not dangerous, unless you are close 
          enough to get sucked in.
              Note: Crabs that are sucked into implosions are returned 
          after five seconds.  Returning crabs reappear at the location of 
          the exit door, whether that door has appeared or not (but not if 
          the location where the door is to appear is occupied by another 
          object).
              If you would like to view the action of an implosion closely, 
          start the game with the command "FGODMOM FIP" at the DOS prompt.  
          Then, when an implosion occurs, the game will freeze until you 
          press a key.  This feature allows you see exactly what happens 
          when an implosion occurs.
          
          
                                     EXTRA LIVES
          
              Every time you are caught by a crab, sealed in a wall, or 
          caught in an implosion, you lose a life.  However, there are ways 
          to earn extra lives during the game.  For every level you finish, 
          you earn an extra life.  You can also earn extra lives by 
          collecting the bonus markers (shaped like gold coins marked with 
          wand stars).  The bonus markers appear when you have collected 
          the seven pennies.  Every bonus marker you have (at the instant 
          you finish the level or get caught) is worth one extra life.
          
          
                               WARPING TO OTHER LEVELS
          
              It is possible in F.Godmom to jump to other levels by 
          pressing the <W> key.  However, you need a special magical object 
          to teleport in this way.  I leave the puzzle of how to warp in 
          your hands.  If you cannot figure out the secret on your own, you 
          can send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Soggybread 
          Software, and I will send you the secret of warping.  Hint: To 
          warp you must create a magical object called a "warp door" by 
          projecting the pattern of one object onto another.

                                 GAME CONTROL NOTES
          
          Here are a few important things to know about the game controls:
              1) If you press <P> while in the pause mode, the game will     
                 unpause and then immediately repause.  This allows you to   
                 run the game frame-by-frame (to examine how the crabs move  
                 or whatever.)  Hit a key other than <P> to stop pausing.
              2) When you save a game with the <S> key, the game will        
                 always be saved to the file "SAVEGAME.DAT".
              3) If you try to restore a game with <R>, and the file         
                 "SAVEGAME.DAT" does not exist, the program ignore you.
              4) You must have the magic warp key to use the warp command.   
                 You are supposed to figure out how to get the magic warp    
                 key on your own.  However, there are other ways to find     
                 out how to get it.  (see FREE STUFF)

                                  IF YOU ARE STUCK
          
          There are several ways to get help if you are stuck:
              1) If you do not know how to complete level #1, see the        
                 section on the next page, "How To Complete Level #1."
              2) If you are stuck at another level, it may be because you    
                 have forgotten one of the rules of the game.  Select RULES  
                 from the menu to review the rules during the game.
              3) To get a hint for a particular level, select HINT FOR       
                 CURRENT LEVEL from the menu.  You should save this feature  
                 for when you are REALLY stuck, though.  (We wouldn't want   
                 you to get hint addicted, would we?)
              4) You may want to use the magic warp door to bypass a         
                 troublesome level until you can come back to it.

                              HOW TO COMPLETE LEVEL #1
          
          Completing level #1 is fairly easy.  Just follow these 
          instructions:
              1) Scan the pattern of the ladder to your left by pressing 
                 the <Ctrl> key (or any key on bottom row of the keyboard). 
                 If you do this correctly, your WAND PATTERN box  
                 (displayed at the bottom of the screen) will contain a 
                 picture of a ladder.
              2) Use the arrow keys to make the fairy walk forward until     
                 she stops against the brick wall.
              3) Project the pattern of the ladder onto the brick wall by 
                 pressing the <Alt> or the space bar.
              4) Walk past the ladder to the right.  (You must do this 
                 quickly, because the brick wall will remain a ladder for 
                 only five seconds.)
              5) Repeat steps #4 and #5 until you are past the brick walls.
              6) Collect all seven pennies and the key.  The exit door 
                 will appear once you have collected the seven pennies.

                        ***** REGISTRATION INFORMATION *****
          
                             $5.00 REGISTRATION BENEFITS
          
              At the five dollar registration level you get a copy of 
          F.GODMOM TIPS AND SECRETS.  This "cheat sheet" contains 
          information on how to release some of F.Godmom's neat and 
          convenient features.  These features are not necessary for 
          playing, winning or enjoying the game, but make the game a whole 
          lot more fun to play.  With your $5 registration, you will learn 
          how to:
              CAMOUFLAGE THE FAIRY OR CRABS (as a brick wall, a ladder, a    
                  key, etc.  this really looks neat)
              MAKE THE GAME SAVE AUTOMATICALLY (as you finish each level)
              MAKE THE GAME RUN AT MAXIMUM SPEED (you can't really play the  
                  game at this speed, but it's fun to watch)
              START THE GAME WITH 99 LIVES (makes it a little harder to run  
                  out)
              MAKE THE FAIRIES DANCE (even if you have not finished all of   
                  the levels)
              SPEED UP THE GAME (makes the game more challenging)
              SLOW DOWN THE GAME (makes the game easier)
              MAKE THE PAUSE INVISIBLE (clears your view of the playing      
                  field)
              WARP TO OTHER LEVELS (actually you learn how to create the     
                  magic warp key)
              CAMOUFLAGE THE FAIRY LOOK AS A CRAB (this looks way cool;      
                  beams shoot from your claws)
              SKIP THE ANNOYING TEXT SCREENS ('nuff said)
              MAKE THE TRANSFORMATIONS LAST LONGER (ten seconds instead of   
                  five)
          
              Along with the above information, you will get valuable 
          playing tips from the game's author.  (There's no better source.)
          
              You can use one of the handy order forms at the end of the 
          manual to help you register.
          
          
                            $10.00 REGISTRATION BENEFITS
          
              If you register at the ten dollar level, you get even more 
          great stuff.  Of course you will get a copy of F.GODMOM TIPS AND 
          SECRETS like a $5 registration, but you also get a disk with:
          
                           THE LATEST VERSION OF F.GODMOM
                                        plus
                      FIFTY EXTRA LEVELS FOR THE GAME F.GODMOM
          
              These new levels are filled with new puzzles.  If you thought 
          the last fifty levels were challenging, you ain't seen nothin' 
          yet.
              You can use one of the handy order forms at the end of the 
          manual to help you register.

                            $20.00 REGISTRATION BENEFITS
          
              The twenty dollar registration brings the best bonuses.  Not 
          only do you get F.GODMOM TIPS AND SECRETS and FIFTY EXTRA LEVELS, 
          you also get F.GODMOM SOLUTIONS, an illustrated solution book to 
          help you through the toughest levels.
              Are you having trouble getting past levels #9, #11, #37 or 
          #44?  Get this solutions book and you will learn how I, John 
          Blackwell, the only living Grand Master F.Godmom player, get past 
          those levels every time.
              You can use one of the handy order forms at the end of the 
          manual to help you register.
          
          
                                      UPGRADES
          
              If you can't decide between two registration levels, don't 
          worry.  Go ahead and register at the lower level.  If you later 
          decide that you want the benefits of a higher registration, you 
          will not have to pay twice.  Any money that you send toward 
          registering your copy of F.Godmom can go toward your updating 
          your registration.
              So, for instance, if you register at the $10 level and later 
          decide that you want the solution manual, you don't have to send 
          $20 more.  Just send $10 to cover the difference.
              You can use one of the handy order forms at the end of the 
          manual to help you upgrade you registration.
          
          
                                     FREE STUFF

          F.Godmom, you may still want to send for some free information 
          from Soggybread Software.  If you send a self-addressed, stamped
